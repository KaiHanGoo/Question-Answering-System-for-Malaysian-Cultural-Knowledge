This project presents a hybrid question answering (QA) system tailored to Malaysian cultural knowledge, integrating both semantic document retrieval and structured knowledge representation. The system addresses the challenge of accessing diverse, multilingual information about Malaysiaâ€™s ethnic groups by processing questions in both Bahasa Malaysia and English. A curated dataset was constructed from over 200 culturally relevant sources through web scraping and PDF extraction, followed by automated and manual refinement. Cleaned content was embedded using multilingual sentence transformers and indexed using FAISS for efficient semantic search. A Neo4j knowledge graph was constructed to encode entity-specific relationships such as food, attire, festivals, and beliefs among ethnic groups. The system dynamically routes queries to either vector-based retrieval or graph-based reasoning depending on their nature. Response generation is handled by a quantized Mistral-7B-Instruct language model enhanced with prompt engineering. Evaluation using BERTScore and cosine similarity shows high semantic accuracy (0.855 and 0.765 respectively) and 99% answer coverage with low latency. The deployed web interface supports multilingual interaction and dynamic retraining from user feedback. This work contributes an effective, extensible framework for domain-specific QA in multilingual and culturally rich contexts.
